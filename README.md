Histogram of oriented gradients(HOG) is used in the process of object detection in digital images.
Function detect() compares two images(which have gone through some kind of image segmentation) using HOG and returns their similarity in range of [0,1], 
where greater value indicates higher similarity. It doesnt depend on image dimensions, meaning we can compare two images of different dimensions.
Program is made in Processing and written in Java.
